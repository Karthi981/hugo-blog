## What is openwebui?

OpenWebUI is a web interface for running OpenAI's API locally. It allows you to interact with OpenAI's API without having to install any software on your computer. You can use it to run your own chatbots, generate images, and more.

## How to Run Deepseek AI Locally and run it in your smartphone via ngrok?

To run Deepseek AI locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker: You can download and install Docker from the official website. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```
docker --version
```

If any error occurs, when checking the version, try editing your environment variables with the PATH variable.Usually it should be resolved by adding `C:/ProgramFiles/Docker/Docker/resources/bin`and `C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop\version-bin` to the PATH variable.

Search for edit environment variables and click on it.

On the Popup window, click on Environment Variables and click on Path under User Variables.And edit the PATH variable to include the path of Docker.

```bash
C:/ProgramFiles/Docker/Docker/resources/bin


C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop\version-bin

```

2. Pull the OpenWebUI image using docker:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

This should pull the OpenWebUI image from the GitHub repository and start the container.The -p flag specifies the port mapping, which in this case is 3000:8080. The --add-host flag is used to map the host's internal IP address to the container's host.The -v flag is used to mount a volume from the host to the container. In this case, it is mounted to the open-webui directory in the container.

Now the OpenWebUI container is running and you can access it at http://localhost:3000.

3.Now you could see it running locally on your pc.

```

Then the auth token will be saved in a Local directory of ngrok.

3. Now run the following command to start the ngrok tunnel:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure that the port number is 3000 in which the openwebui is running.You can configure ports in docker desktop for the openwebui container.
